# BizRWebApp

This was the final project for my databases class. It functions as a social network written with Java (JSPs) running on a Glassfish server and writing to a MySQL database. It has functions for user registration and login, as well as basic private messaging, user searching, group creation and manipulation and joining/leaving, and wall posts/comments/likes. It also features "targeted advertising" features which aren't as prominent. They were just made to showcase that I could do them, but the cool and useful thing about the project is the basic social network aspect.
The databse connections are configured via the Glassfish Admin Interface, so if you're trying to run on your own machine, you should either copy my connection names or put in your own database credentials.
